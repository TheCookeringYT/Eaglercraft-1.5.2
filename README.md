How to use the code properly: 

        
	
 Step 1: First, fork the project. Then, next to "Insights" there should be a button called "Settings" next to it. If you clicked on it scroll until it says pages.
        
        
	
 Step 2: Under were it says branch there should be 2 buttons. One of them says "None" and the other says "Save".
        
        
	
 Step 3: Click the "None" button and click "Main" if its not there click "Master" then click "Save" AND DO NOT CHANGE "/ (root)" AT ALL! 
       
        
	
 Step 4: After it finishes your website or Github Page it should say 404 Error, now at the URL and type Offline_Download_Version.html and the URL should look like this "thecookeringyt.github.io/Eaglercraft-1.5.2/Offline_Download_Version.html".
	
 
 Step 5: Refresh and now you have Eaglercraft 1.5.2 with better FPS! 8-)
